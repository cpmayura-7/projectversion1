            <p class="p-welcome1">A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his own.<br> 
                The calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing <br>
                field and the glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his extraordinary leadership skills.<br>
                 He was the face of Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to two titles (2010 & 2011) <br>
                 and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the league.<br>
                 And, he once again became the first player to be retained by CSK ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league <br>had a 
                 fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the Chennai Super Kings.</p>
